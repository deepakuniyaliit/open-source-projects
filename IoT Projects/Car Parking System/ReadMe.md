# Automated-Car-Parking-System
___
## 1.0 About Project : 

- This project just needs a power supply through a simple USB to B-type along with an adaptor.
- The system makes use of Arduino Uno Board, Servo Motor and IR sensors. 
- It provides real time working of Automated Car Parking System. 
- As it's name says, "Automated", and hence no need for any human intervention. 
- The project opens the entry gate when a vehicle reaches the gate automatically.
- This project is connected in such a way that it will show a Red light at the entrance if parking is full. 
- It will also not let gates open during entry if parking slot is full.
- Until another vehicle leaves the parking, exit gate will not open. (Because if no car left the parking, then why should the exit gate open? )
- During Exit, the gate opens automatically when vehicle reaches the gate.
